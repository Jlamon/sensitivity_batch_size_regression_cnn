### Research Project:  *Learning Image Transformation with Convolutional Neural Networks*

### Research Questions
As indicated already, the overall research aim is to get a deeper understanding of how and especially why the networks you choose to analyze do or do not work for the designed tasks. We foresee that the performance of the networks also depends on further details of the experimental setup. Each student will investigate one of the following aspects.

1. How do the different datasets affect the performance? (Ratish Thakoersingh)
2. How sensitive are the networks to hyperparameters?  (Julien Lamon)
3. What influence does the network architecture have on the performance? (Remco Den Heijer)
4. What happens to the performance of networks when trained on one dataset and evaluated on another? (Julian Biesheuvel)

### Project Aim:
While deep nets are nowadays used in all kinds of applications, various aspects of these learning machines are still not well understood. In this project we are going to analyze deep neural networks on a new synthetic learning task created by you. The aim is to get a better understanding of what deep networks can and cannot do and, and more importantly, why they are or arenâ€™t able to do so.
